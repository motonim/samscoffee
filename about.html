		<h3>We’ve got a lot going on</h3>

				<h4>SAM'S BOOK CLUB</h4>	
				<p>The Specialty Coffee movement has made the story of coffee – how it gets from the farmer to the roaster to the shop to your cup – an important part of the drinking experience. But we like other stories too. So every month or so we have one of our baristas pick a book to devour and discuss. Read along!</p>
				
			</div>
		
		
			<div class="col-md">
						
				<h4>THURSDAY NIGHT THROWDOWNS</h4>	
				<p>A little friendly competition (that happens to involve a few dollars) can really inspire some creativity. We’re having our best baristas go head-to- head to see who can keep a steady hand under pressure and pour the most breathtaking micro-foam artwork in their latte. We’ll keep you updated with winning baristas, winning artwork, and your chance to compete.</p>
		
			</div>
		
		
			<div class="col-md">
						
				<h4>FILM CLUB</h4>
				<p>A great man once said, “If you have a big enough wall there’s no reason not to project movies on it.” So, in the proud tradition of Sam’s Book Club, we’ve started getting together, having a few drinks, and watching some wonderful films from all corners of the cinematic world. Which dance number from Singin’ in the Rain is your favorite?</p>
